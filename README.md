A simple tool to generate random password strings.

## ðŸ“„ Overview 

This simple project was the second I've built, which I used to gain practical experience with building business logic using JavaScript.

Structured as a **single-page application**, the app allows users to customise the character type to include in their password, as well as specify its length.

The option also exists to include English words into the password to make it easier to remember.

There is also strength logic baked into the app to determine the strength of the password based on it's length and variation in characters used.

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used 

**Vanilla JS** and **CSS** is used to build the logic and styling of the application.

The static site is hosted through **Render** as the hosting provider.

Given the lightweight nature of the app, the entire codebase including service logic is hosted on the client-side.

## ðŸ”¥ Features 
- Choose one or many character options from uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols;
- Include common words from the English language;
- Slider to select desired length;
- Strength gauge for the generated password;
